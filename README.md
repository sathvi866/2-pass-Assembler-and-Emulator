# 2-pass-Assembler-and-Emulator
Developed a two-pass assembler for an extended SIMPLE instruction set using C++.
Designed an assembler that processes assembly language, assigns label values, diagnoses errors, and generates an object file with machine code.
Implemented an emulator to execute SIMPLE machine instructions, simulating stack-based operations.
Wrote a Bubble Sort algorithm in SIMPLE assembly language.
Debugged and tested the assembler with multiple test cases, ensuring accuracy in machine code generation.
Handled file I/O operations for reading assembly code and generating output files efficiently.
Utilized object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to structure the assembler and emulator for maintainability.
