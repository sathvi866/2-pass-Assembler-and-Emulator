# 2-pass-Assembler-and-Emulator
Developed a two-pass assembler for an extended SIMPLE instruction set using C++.
Designed an assembler that processes assembly language, assigns label values, diagnoses errors, and generates an object file with machine code.
Implemented an emulator to execute SIMPLE machine instructions, simulating stack-based operations.
